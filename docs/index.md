# genix Static Site Generator

## Overview

**genix** is an ultra-lightweight static site generator written in Go with zero dependencies. Designed for developers and power users, it offers full control over your site's markup while keeping abstractions to a minimum.

At its core, genix uses a Go-based HTML compiler to parse templates and generate static HTML files, ready for deployment. Setup is quick and easy. A single command installs and configures the local development environment, including built-in documentation.

For Linux users, a bundled shell script simplifies the process of converting Markdown files into HTML. This makes it easy to export content from Google Drive and publish it directly to your custom site.
